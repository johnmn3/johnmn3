It takes any data structure (list, vector, map, set,\nseq), calls a function on every element, and uses the return value\nof the function in place of the original.  This makes it fairly\neasy to write recursive search-and-replace functions, as shown in\nthe examples.\n\nNote: \"walk\" supports all Clojure data structures EXCEPT maps\ncreated with sorted-map-by.  There is no (obvious) way to retrieve\nthe sorting function."],"~:use-macros",null,"~:excludes",["~#set",[]],"~:name","~$clojure.walk","~:imports",null,"~:requires",["^ ","~$cljs.core","^A","~$goog","^B"],"~:seen",["^<",[]],"~:uses",null,"~:defs",["^ ","~$walk",["^ ","~:protocol-inline",null,"^2",["^ ","^3","clojure/walk.cljs","^4",37,"^5",7,"^6",37,"^7",11,"~:arglists",["~#list",["~$quote",["^I",[["~$inner","~$outer","~$form"]]]]],"^9","Traverses form, an arbitrary data structure.  inner and outer are\n  functions.
